## NIOSH
- HELD
  - Our division (Health Effects Laboratory Division [(HELD)](https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/contact/im-held.html)) is located at Morgantown, West Virginia. As a federal research institute, we are happy to work with industrial developers and academic collaborators to develop efficient and comprehensive evaluation procedures and publish peer-reviewed communications (standards organizations value our results and reports).

- Test: 
  - We plan to do the first test (Load positioning, move the load among four positions, page 4) this summer. We will measure ground reaction force, subjects’ kinematics and physiological response with and without wearing upper-body/back exoskeletons (e.g., using EMG, NIRS, ECG, Vicon and force plate). It would be our first exoskeleton test to explore what  we need for the future evaluation and modeling. 

  - We will start with the NIST-suggested exoskeleton testing: probably first with Load Positioning (move the load among four positions; test 1 in the video: https://www.nist.gov/video/training-video-exoskeleton-study ). We will measure ground reaction force, subjects’ kinematics and physiological response with and without wearing upper-body/back exoskeletons (e.g., using EMG, NIRS, ECG, Vicon and force plate). It would be our first exoskeleton test to explore what we need for the future evaluation and modeling. 
  - I also want to list the exoskeletons we have so far (there might be more).  We have purchased three passive exoskeletons.
    - EksoVest by Ekso Bionics
	- SuitX modular system (BackX, LegX and ShoulderX ) by U.S. Bionics
	- Airframe by Levitate
	- We also start collaborating with Dr. Conor Walsh (from Harvard University) and they will provide their powered [back-assist exosuit prototype](https://wyss.harvard.edu/technology/soft-exosuits-for-back-support-during-strenuous-tasks/) for us to evaluate. Their team might come to our center and help calibrate/setup their exosuit for the testing (our results will help them further improve the prototype).
