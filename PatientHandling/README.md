# Patient Handling
## How NIOSH Identifies research priorities: Burden, Need, and Impact(BNI):
  - [What do we mean by Burden, Need and Impact?](https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/programs/bni.html)

  - **Burden**
    - General statement of burden
	
	- Exposure/Hazard
	
	- Injury/Illness
	
	- Disability/Severity
	
	- cost
	
	- Literature and online information:
	  - Bureau of labor statistics (BLS)
	    - [What Nursing Assistants and Orderlies Do](https://www.bls.gov/ooh/healthcare/nursing-assistants.htm#tab-2): Nursing assistants, sometimes called nursing aides, help provide basic care for patients in hospitals and residents of long-term care facilities, such as nursing homes. Orderlies transport patients and clean treatment areas.
		- Occupational Employment and Wages, May 2017: 
		  - [31-1014 Nursing Assistants](https://www.bls.gov/oes/current/oes311014.htm): Provide basic patient care under direction of nursing staff. Perform duties such as feed, bathe, dress, groom, or move patients, or change linens. May transfer or transport patients. Includes nursing care attendants, nursing aides, and nursing attendants. 
		  - [31-1015 Orderlies](https://www.bls.gov/oes/current/oes311015.htm): Transport patients to areas such as operating rooms or x-ray rooms using wheelchairs, stretchers, or moveable beds. May maintain stocks of supplies or clean and transport equipment. 
		  - [29-1171 Nurse practitioners](https://www.bls.gov/oes/current/oes291171.htm): Diagnose and treat acute, episodic, or chronic illness, independently or as part of a healthcare team. May focus on health promotion and disease prevention. May order, perform, or interpret diagnostic tests such as lab work and x rays. May prescribe medication. Must be registered nurses who have specialized graduate education.
		  - [29-1141 Registered Nurses](https://www.bls.gov/oes/2017/may/oes291141.htm): Assess patient health problems and needs, develop and implement nursing care plans, and maintain medical records. Administer nursing care to ill, injured, convalescent, or disabled patients. May advise patients on health maintenance and disease prevention or provide case management. Licensing or registration required. Registered nurses, with 2.9 million jobs, was the **largest** healthcare occupation.
		  - Other than registered nurses, the largest healthcare occupations were nursing assistants (1.5 million), home health aides (820,960), and licensed practical and licensed vocational nurses (702,700). (See [table 1](https://www.bls.gov/news.release/pdf/ocwage.pdf))

		   - Nearly 21 million workers are employed in private and public sector industries covered by the Healthcare and Social Assistance (HCSA) program in 2016. 
		   - **Burden**: According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, in 2016 there were 154,680 total injury and illness cases with days away from work in the HCSA sector, accounting for 17.3% of all such cases in all private industry.1 The highest incidence rate (reported as cases per 10,000 FTEs) of injury and illness cases with days away from work was in other residential care facilities (241.5), psychiatric and substance abuse hospitals (228.5) and nursing care facilities (201.6).2  The following occupations had the highest incidence rates : psychiatric aides (671), psychiatric technicians (594), occupational therapy aides (304) and  nurse orderlies (302).3
           - **Need**: 
		       - The incidence rate of MSDs in the HCSA sector (42.9) ranks second among all other industries and is 44% higher than the average for all private industry establishments.4 The incidence rate for MSDs are even higher in HCSA state and local government establishments, 210% and 37% respectively.4
		       - Some jobs within HCSA have higher MSD rates than others, such as nurses, nursing assistants and home health aides. In 2015, nursing assistants had the second highest number of cases (19,360) and 3rd highest incidence rate (180.5) of MSDs among all occupations across all ownerships (i.e., total private, state and local government). 5
           - **Impact**: Expanding the NIOSH effort on this goal will advance NIOSH impact on developing effective and practical strategies to prevent MSDs in HCSA, which will also impact other industrial sectors including construction, public safety, services, oil and gas, and manufacturing. NIOSH has a track record of implementing and evaluating interventions for reducing MSDs and is poised to continue such work in this sector.  The Revised NIOSH Lifting Equation helps healthcare workers determine how much weight can be safely lifted without using assistive equipment. Other resources such as the Safe Lifting and Movement of Nursing Home Residents continue to provide information to employers and workers in the HCSA sector.

		  - Existing issues:
 		     - [Noble, 2018](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28486032): 
			   - Although assistive devices are used more often when repositioning a patient in bed (e.g., moving patients up in bed or transferring patients to a stretcher), the devices are used much less frequent when assisting patients with ambulation, transferring to the bathroom, and transferring to the bedside commode.
			   - The most influential factors in the decision to use assistive devices for patient transfers are time constraints and difficult patient-handling situations

		  - In general, the revised equation yields a recommended **35-lb.** maximum weight limit for use in patient-handling tasks. When weight to be lifted exceeds this limit, assistive devices should be used.
