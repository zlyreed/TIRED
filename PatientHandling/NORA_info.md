    - [NORA Healthcare and Social Assistance Sector](https://www.cdc.gov/nora/councils/hcsa/default.html)
      - [Healthcare and Social Assistance Program](https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/programs/hcsa/)’s mission is to eliminate occupational diseases, injuries, and fatalities and improve health and well-being among those who work in industries providing human and veterinary healthcare and that provide social assistance services across a broad range of settings such as hospitals, clinics, nursing and private homes, and child day care.
    - [NORA Musculoskeletal Health Cross-Sector](https://www.cdc.gov/nora/councils/mus/default.html): focuses on preventing musculoskeletal disorders, which are soft-tissue injuries caused by sudden or sustained exposure to repetitive motion, force, vibration, or awkward positions.

	    - Healthcare and Social Assistance/Musculoskeletal Health (HSAxMUS):
		  - Intermediate goal 4.8: Employers, workers, professional organizations, researchers, and policy-makers use NIOSH information to reduce musculoskeletal disorders among healthcare and social assistance workers. 
	      - Intermediate goal 4.8E: Evaluation of exoskeletons or other innovative approaches to reduce risk of MSDs during patient handling or performing healthcare procedures.
		  - Activity Goal 4.8.1 (Intervention research): Conduct studies to evaluate the effectiveness (usefulness and unexpected results) of innovative approaches to reduce risk for MSDs and to reduce the return-to-work time among healthcare and social assistance workers with MSDs.

  - [National Occupational Research Agenda for Musculoskeletal Health](https://www.cdc.gov/nora/councils/mus/researchagenda.html):
    The National Occupational Research Agenda for Musculoskeletal Health is intended to identify the knowledge and actions most urgently needed to prevent musculoskeletal disorders (MSDs). This agenda provides a vehicle for stakeholders to describe the most relevant issues, research gaps, and needs for occupational musculosketetal health. It is meant to be broader than any one agency or organization.
Agenda development began in early 2017, when the Musculoskeletal Health Council held a series of monthly meetings to discuss research topics seen as gaps in the body of knowledge on workplace MSDs. Between meetings, individual members or ad hoc working groups comprised of Council members met to develop text for each of the topics. In May 2017, the Council Co-Chairs consolidated and edited the draft document to turn it into a more cohesive document rather than individual paragraphs or sections based on topic area created by the working groups. In May, June, and July Council members were given the opportunity to discuss the changes or edits made by the Co-Chairs and the initial draft of the National Occupational Research Agenda for Musculoskeletal Health was completed in February 2018 and prepared for public comment at that time. Minor revisions were made in response to the comments, and the final version was published.
     - Objective 1: Define the incidence and impact of musculoskeletal disorders (MSDs)
	 - Objective 2: Understand the risk factors for work-related MSDs
	 - Objective 3: Describe the underlying mechanisms of MSDs
	 - Objective 4: Develop and evaluate interventions to prevent MSDs and limit disability due to MSDs
	 - Objective 5: Disseminate and implement interventions to prevent MSDs and limit disability
	 
	 
  - [National Occupational Research Agenda for Healthcare and Social Assistance:](https://www.cdc.gov/nora/councils/hcsa/agenda.html)
    The National Occupational Research Agenda for Healthcare and Social Assistance (HCSA) is intended to identify the knowledge and actions most urgently needed to improve occupational safety and health in this industry sector. This agenda provides a vehicle for stakeholders to describe the most relevant issues, research gaps, and needs for the HCSA workforce. It is meant to be broader than any one agency or organization.
	 - Objective 1: Assess how work organization impacts both worker and patient safety.
	 - Objective 2: Assess the impact of organizational culture and leadership on worker and patient safety including satisfaction/quality of life.
	 - Objective 3: Investigate the epidemiology of workplace violence in health care and identify effective strategies for prevention and mitigation.
	 - Objective 4: Determine the effectiveness of innovative technologies and organizational strategies to improve recommended standard and transmission-based precautions in healthcare settings.
	 - Objective 5: Promote development and identify impact of occupational infectious disease surveillance to improve infection control and biosafety practices in healthcare settings in order to minimize or eliminate healthcare personnel exposures to infectious diseases and to better understand how these diseases spread.
	 - Objective 6: Assess awareness and increase knowledge of sharps injury prevention programs, and improve injury surveillance programs designed to prevent sharps injuries among healthcare personnel.
	 - Objective 7: Determine the impact of current and new interventions and technologies designed to prevent sharps injuries among healthcare personnel.
	 - Objective 8: Facilitate safe patient handling and mobility in healthcare systems by conducting research to develop and assess cost-benefit tools, workplace design and equipment management protocols, and strategies to improve sustained support of safe patient handling and mobility programs by workers, managers, and executives.
	 - **Objective 9: Conduct special topics research to improve safety in areas with distinct safe patient handling and mobility needs and explore the potential use of new, non-traditional assistive devices.**
	 - Objective 10: Develop and evaluate updated safe patient handling and mobility education in nursing schools and healthcare workplaces, and initiate new research to address gaps in safe patient handling and mobility education.
	 - Objective 11: Conduct research that develops, implements, and evaluates prevention programs and design strategies that decrease the risk of slip, trip and fall incidents and identify barriers to intervention implementation.
	 - Objective 12: Develop and implement methods to identify, assess, control and prevent exposure to hazardous drugs, biological pharmaceuticals, reproductive hormones and other chemicals (e.g., cleaners, disinfectants, sterilants) in acute care human and veterinary healthcare settings and for difficult-to-access, low wage and underserved workers in home care, animal care, day care and other social services.
	 - Objective 13: Identify and evaluate methods to promote adoption and implementation of hazardous drug safe handling programs in non-hospital settings and veterinary practices.
	 - Objective 14: Increase knowledge about, implement strategies to mitigate, and evaluate existing prevention strategies regarding biological, physical and psychological hazards to veterinary and animal care workers.
	 - Objective 15: Develop or adapt, implement, and evaluate interventions found to be effective in acute healthcare and other settings for long term care, home care, home healthcare, correctional care, child care, and other social services.
	 - Objective 16: Explore the impact of emerging and existing work organization factors and nontraditional systems on worker health and safety, with a particular emphasis on low-wage occupations.
	 - Objective 17: Establish a strong focus on challenges to the safe care of people in their home environment that engages a broad range of stakeholders in identifying issues and developing solutions.
