## Basic terminology
  - [QRS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QRS_complex): The QRS complex is a name for the combination of three of the graphical deflections seen on a typical electrocardiogram (EKG or ECG). In other words, it's the main spike seen on an ECG line.

  - [R-R interval](https://emedicine.medscape.com/article/2172196-overview)
    ![R-R-interval-trace.png](pics/R-R-interval-trace.png "R-R-interval-trace")
  - [Normal-to-Normal(NN) interval](https://psychology.stackexchange.com/questions/16076/what-is-the-difference-between-rr-intervals-and-nn-intervals-in-hrv-data) (filter RR intervals to produce NN intervals): all intervals between adjacent QRS complexes resulting sinus node depolarization.
     - The difference between RR interval and NN interval: NN intervals refer to the intervals between **normal** R-peaks. During a measurement, artifacts may arise due to arrhythmic events or faulty sensors, for example (Citi, Brown & Barbieri, 2012). This may lead to abnormal R-peaks, which may in turn distort the statistical measures. To ensure reliable and valid data, only normal R-peaks are selected. Alternatively, the abnormal R-peaks can be corrected. 
	 In practice, however, RR-intervals and NN-intervals are synonymous (Tarvainen, 2014; Wiki). The use of "NN-intervals" is merely used to emphasize that normal R-peaks were used. 
  - [Heart Rate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart_rate): [The instantaneous heart rate](https://courses.kcumb.edu/physio/ecg%20primer/normecgcalcs.htm) can be calculated from the time between any two QRS complexes.

	**Data Process**
	  ```
	  wfdb_header - Read record metadata from a WFDB header file (.hea).

  - Notes: 
	 - Missing padarray function (from Image Processing Toolbox); here using several [online functions](https://github.com/gpeyre/matlab-toolboxes/tree/master/toolbox_nlmeans/toolbox/ordfilt2) ([padarray.m](padarray.m) calls [checkstrs.m](checkstrs.m) and [mkconstarray.m](mkconstarray.m)) to substitute.
	 - [File Format from Q&A](https://physionet.org/faq.shtml): 
	    - MIT Signal files (.dat) are binary files containing samples of digitized signals. These store the waveforms, but they cannot be interpreted properly without their corresponding header files. These files are in the form: RECORDNAME.dat.
		- MIT Header files (.hea) are short text files that describe the contents of associated signal files. These files are in the form: RECORDNAME.hea.
		- MIT Annotation files are binary files containing annotations (labels that generally refer to specific samples in associated signal files). Annotation files should be read with their associated header files. If you see files in a directory called RECORDNAME.dat, or RECORDNAME.hea, any other file with the same name but different extension, for example RECORDNAME.atr, is an annotation file for that record.
	 - Modify default parameter values of the mhrv toolbox: you can edit [cfg/defaults.yml](defaults.yml), and [cfd/gqrs.conf](gqrs.default.conf)
 
##### **Work on our ECG and RR-interval data output from [Biomonitor](https://www.noraxon.com/noraxon-download/dts-biomonitor-user-manual/):**
  - **confirm the RR-interval output**:
	- normal RR interval [range](https://emedicine.medscape.com/article/2172196-overview): 0.6-1.2 seconds?; 

	- **Method 1**: use [ECG2RRi_test.m](ECG2RRi_test.m) to compare the RRi calucated from ECG (mhrv, rqrs: R-peak detection) and Biomonitor-output RRi, which were comparable after changing [cfd/gqrs.conf](gqrs.default.conf) as below. 
	  - modify the [cfd/gqrs.conf](gqrs.default.conf):
		  - Default human parameters: 
			```
			RRdelta	0.2	# Typical difference between successive RR intervals in seconds
			RRmin	0.28	# Minimum RR interval ("refractory period"), in seconds
			```
		 - Change to 
			```
			RRdelta	0.6	# Typical difference between successive RR intervals in seconds
			RRmin	0.6	# Minimum RR interval ("refractory period"), in seconds
		    ```
	  - Note: The parameter changes do not working with all the trials (the results seem pretty sensitive with the parameters). Maybe need to flip the ECG data (not working all the time either).
	
    - **Method 2**: use rri output from Biomonitor
	  - remove flat "step" data in rri (calls [rmvStep.m](rmvStep.m): use the indices of the beginning of the steps;
	  - filtered: [\mhrv\rri\filtrr.m](filtrr.m)
	  - Note: still look bad on some subjects and some trials (e.g., large noises)
	
    - **Method 3 (Recommended!)**: use "\mhrv\ecg\jqrs.m" fucntion to calculate RR intervals (2019/6/3) 
      - Use "PhysioZoo" software to find out the better peak detection algorithm. More information on [peak detection](https://docs.physiozoo.com/en/stable/sections/tutorials/peakdetection.html) 
	    - Preprocess the data for "PhysioZoo": use [Mat2WFDB_ecg_mV.m](Mat2WFDB_ecg_mV.m) to preprocessing the data, which calls [mat2wfdb.m](mat2wfdb.m). Note: The input ECG data imported in PhysioZoo MUST be in mV (i.e. physiological units). The R-peak detector might not run appropriately if the data are not correctly scaled.
		- Play with "Peak detector", try different algorithms, and check the "Configuration" to see the desired parameters;
	  - Find a desired algorithm and use [ECG2RRi_forGV.m](ECG2RRi_forGV.m) to process the ECG data and obtain the RRi/NNi data for GV
	    - Use Biomonitor output ECG data directly;
		- calls [\mhrv\ecg\jqrs.m](jqrs.m): detect the indices of the R peaks in ECG data;
		- calls [\mhrv\rri\filtrr.m](filtrr.m): perform outlier detection and removal on RR interval data;
		- time of rri starts from the second R peak location: the Biomonitor output RRi seems to be the same way (but with more noises)
		- Note: 
		  - ECG data are very noise in S18_MVC60 and S14 data; 
		  - The lower peaks (close to R peaks, but in the opposite direction) were detected in S17, S18, S19, S21 and S22.
		  - Good R peaks were selected in S16 and S20; the R peaks were selected correctly but Rs are not the highest peaks in the ECG of S13 and S15
		    - fixed the negative-peak issues in S17, S18, S19, S21 and S22
			
	  - Improvement ( 2019/7/10)
        - Looked at a sample ECG data using "Peak detector" in PhysioZoo, and found the options for choosing "max" or "min" and the corresponding matlab function ["qrs_adjust.m"](qrs_adjust.m);
		- Modified the code[ECG2RRi_forGV_PositivePeaks.m](ECG2RRi_forGV_PositivePeaks.m) to process the ECG data and obtain the RRi/NNi data for GV
    - check data from a sample trial: use [mhrv_fatigue_test.m](mhrv_fatigue_test.m) (which calls [interparc.m](interparc.m) and it has to run on a local drive, e.g., "E:\ECG\mhrv-master\mhrv_fatigue_test.m")
	  - need to update on what to use for nni (Notes of 2019/6/4: found a better algorithm (Method 3), but hasnt changed in "mhrv_fatigue_test.m")
				
		
	- HRV analysis: using hrv_time, hrv_freq, hrv_nonlinear and hrv_fragmentation.
		- Align RPE reading:
		  - plot all the HRV parameters from 4 trials in individual figures [plot_Force_RPE_HRV_4plots.m](plot_Force_RPE_HRV_4plots.m) "; calls [hrv_table_fcn.m](hrv_table_fcn.m), which generates HRV table)
			- [hrv_table_fcn.m](hrv_table_fcn.m) has issues with selected small windows (e.g., 10 seconds) in hrv_frequency and hrv_nonlinear and hrv_fragmentation
		  - try to modify [plot_Force_RPE_HRV_4plots.m](plot_Force_RPE_HRV_4plots.m) using [hrv_table_fcn_noResampling.m](hrv_table_fcn_noResampling.m) and [hrv_table_fcn_Resampling.m](hrv_table_fcn_Resampling.m)  (**10/17/2018**)

### Readings on heart dynamics	
#### HRV on Autonomic Nervous System (ANS) — PSN and SNS (notes from SX):
  - HF (0.15–0.40 Hz): associated with respiratory sinus arrhythmia, and has been attributed to parasympathetic (vagal) activity.
  - LF (0.04–0.15 Hz): assumed to be under the influence of both parasympathetic and sympathetic activity, but predominately by sympathetic activity.
  - LF/HF ratio: a putative measure of sympathovagal balance where higher numbers indicate greater relative sympathetic dominance. 
  - Root Mean Square Successive Differences (RMSSD) and measures of baroreflex sensitivity (an index of the responsiveness of the cardiovascular system to changes in blood pressure) have been shown to be useful indices of vagal activity.

	  - In the current investigation we compared the predictive capability of spectral analyses obtained from a laboratory
	grade EEG system (NuAmps) to the predictive capability of low cost wearable devices (heart rate variability obtained from the
	ZepherTM Biomodule strap and gaze dispersion from eye tracking glasses developed by Pupil Labs)...Participants performed five
	autonomous driving sessions (drives) (~11 min each) during which they monitored an autonomous vehicle lane change task and
	made manual responses to indicate detection of infrequent (20%) automation aid failures signaled by a visual display. Separate
	Linear Mixed-Effects (LMEs) analyses were used to predict response time (RT) to detection failures using spectral analysis of Pz
	alpha-band in comparison to HR, vertical and horizontal gaze dispersion... However, the model using low cost wearable devices was less robust (df(19), BIC = 1970.66) indicating that at present, improved
	sensor technologies are required before wearable devices can achieve the same predictive capabilities of more traditional
	laboratory physiological metrics.
