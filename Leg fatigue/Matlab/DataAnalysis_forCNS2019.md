## CNS 2019 poster (see the [abstract](https://www.cogneurosociety.org/mycns/?mtpage=poster_detail&id=12623))
**1. Based on the pre-processed testing data**
- Processed testing data ([see the processing steps](README.md)) were under the folder ".../MuscleFatigue_Testing" ( S17 to S22 (Test No.: 16 to 21) MVC 30 and MCV60 data; not including trials that are shorter than 3 mins)
- Subject info was recorded in "LegFatigueTesting_RPE_recording.xlsx"
- Matlab code: ".../LegFatigue_matlab/measures_BeforeVsAfter.m"


**2. Measures between the begining (light) and end (tired, RPE>=18)**
- EMG
  - time domain
  - frequency domain

- ECG
  - time domain
  - frequency domain

- NIRS
  - brain (left prefrontal cortex)
  - muscle (rectus femoris)
  
**3. Figures**
- Fig1. testing setup and devices
- Fig2. representative measuring plot: force (MVC 30), RPE, Heart rate and EMG median frequency (lower in the fatigue status)
- Fig3. representative measuring plot: force (MVC 30), RPE, Heart rate and EMG median frequency (comparable in the non-fatigue and fatigue status)
